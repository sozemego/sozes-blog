description: "Introduction to me and the blog"
---

Welcome reader.

This blog will have no technical content. This is just an introduction to me and this blog.

I have masters in social psychology from an university in Poland and I'm a self taught programmer.
At the time of writing this post, I'm a software engineer working on enterprise applications in Java/JavaScript.
I have about 5 years of experience total.

I like programming and learning new techniques, but I would really hate it to do the same thing at home that I do at work.
Since I like gaming as well, I decided to small games with the goal of learning cool new stuff. I don't plan at the moment to do
game dev commercially and abandon my day job.

Here are some of the technologies/languages/buzz words I use for game development (and at work):

Java, Java, React, Redux, xState, Angular, Spring, JBoss, Linux, Windows,
threejs, react-three-fiber, libgdx, gatsby (this blog).

<b>Why does this blog exist?</b>

I made this blog for few reasons:

1. Improve my writing skills

Basically, I suck at this. I have issues translating my thoughts into information that is easily digestible for others.
I want to change that!

2. Improve my thought processes

I frequently get stuck in my head. My gears grind to a halt and anxiety kicks in.
By putting my stream of consciousness on 'paper' I hope to get out of that negative head space. 

3. Hopefully help someone

I could do all that without creating a blog,
but I also like the idea of making other people lives' better, so hopefully this helps someone!
